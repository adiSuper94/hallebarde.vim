Store a list of files as bookmark in the root of the current project.
This allows to open easily a list of bookmarked files.

Same idea as `ThePrimeagen/harpoon`, but without the requirement of neovim 0.5 and harpoon (this plugin only uses `fzf.vim` and is written in vimscript, hence compatible with neovim 0.4 (and possibly vim, I dont know)).
