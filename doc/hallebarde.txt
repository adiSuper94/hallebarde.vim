INTRODUCTION                                    *hallebarde* *hallebarde.vim*

This plugin allows you to store a list of files per project for easy jump
between them. The main logic is similar to marks, but we only store the files
path; the exact location in the files are stored by vim and updated when you
make edits.

The logic is a bit similar to the `ThePrimeagen/harpoon` plugin. However, the
current plugin in only written in vimscript and uses only `junegunn/fzf` and
`junegunn/fzf.vim` as dependencies, hence compatible with neovim 0.4 (and
probably vim).

The list of bookmarked files is stored in the current location. It's
recommanded to open vim directly at the root of the project and store the
files as relatives path. It's also possible to use the full path of files if
thoses are located in an other folder.

If the list contains only 2 elements, and one of them is the current file, the
only action that make sense is to switch to the other file; this automatic
switch is done automatically.

You can use a count prefix to the *Hallebarde* command to open automatically
the `n-th` element from the list. If you want to open the 3rth element of the
list, with the `nmap <Space> <CMD>Hallebarde<CR>` binding, simply type `3<Space>`.
